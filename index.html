            <div class="card-body">
                <p>Passionate about technology and learning, highly motivated and driven to expand knowledge and skills in the tech industry. 
                    I believe that continuous learning is crucial in staying ahead of the curve in such a dynamic field. 
                    I’m a self-starter who enjoys taking on new challenges and is willing to step out of my comfort zone to acquire new skills. 
                    I’m not afraid to take on complex tasks and find creative solutions to problems.</p>
                    <hr>
                <p>I successfully completed an Open Learning Course in Full-stack Web Development Bootcamp in 2021, which significantly fueled 
                    my passion for technology. Presently, I'm pursuing my studies at Edinburgh College, where I'm midway through 
                    the HND Computing Software Development Course, a journey that began in August 2022 and is ongoing.</p>
                    <hr>
                <p>Additionally, for the academic year 2023, I have enrolled as a student at Herriot Watt, where I'm studying 
                    Fundamental Mathematics for Computer Science, in parallel with my ongoing College coursework. 
                    Alongside the standard curriculum, I have proactively sought extension learning opportunities and supplemented 
                    my studies with tutorials available through LinkedIn Learning Resources.</p>  
                    <hr>  
                <p>I always look for new opportunities to learn and grow my skills in the tech industry.
                   My willingness to learn, passion for technology, dedication, excellent communication, 
                   and problem-solving skills make me a suitable candidate for a future job role. I am eager to learn and develop my skills further 
                   in a practical work setting. I am confident that I can contribute to the growth and success of your organization.</p>
